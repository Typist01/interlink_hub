        "description": "Can we expect there to be a relationship between the frequency at whidch our heart beats and our perception of time. The first thing to do would be to define the perception of time in a clear way but it's difficult to do so without going deep into psychology. But a simple way to do this would be to make the experimentee listen to a metronome for about 5 seconds and ask them to perform an acitvity at a rate which accurately follows the metronome. Repeat the experiment accross several types of people of varying resting heart rates to figure out whether there is a relationship. This can be extended for a non resting heart rate, for example after a 10 minute exercise."

        "title": "Relationship between visual perception and extended measure of time",
        "description": "The key measurement to make here is the see how long a person's accurate perception of time can last. For example, present a person a measure of time through a metronome and ask the person to do some task that would replicate this frequency and see how long they can accurately reproduce the frequency until it falls out of an acceptable error range. Repeat this with blindfolded candidates"

        "description": "Imagine if the tiny particles that make up everything in the universe also played a role in how we think and feel. This idea combines brain science with the weird world of quantum physics, suggesting that the principles of particles being everywhere at once (quantum superposition) and instant connections across distances (quantum entanglement) might actually explain consciousness. It's like saying our ability to make choices, experience moments, and come up with new ideas could all be influenced by quantum mechanics. For uni students interested in this, diving into both neuroscience and quantum physics basics could be the first step. Exploring this further could lead to revolutionary ways of understanding how our minds work."
